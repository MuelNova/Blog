First, we need to bypass this decryption. We can use [Z3 Prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) for solving (so, anyone calculating manually? Ha ha, it's actually me)

Here, it can be noted that `buf` can overflow to modify the value of `i`, thus changing a byte's value. At the same time, here `buf[(int)read]`, filling 0x100 bytes can overwrite the highest bit of `rbp` to 0.

Therefore, we can modify the last byte of the return address to return to another `leave; ret`, combined with modifying the last byte to perform stack migration.

Since the migration address is uncertain, we can fill the address of `ret` as slide code to increase the success rate (similar to filling shellcode with `\x90`).

Leak libc using `puts` for the first time, and then it is possible to trigger `one_gadget` or return to `system` for the second time.

The exploit was quite complicated to write.
