# Build AirSim on Windows

### Install Unreal Engine 4

1. Download [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/download).
2. Run Epic Games Launcher and download a version of **Unreal Engine 4 >= 4.25**.

<!--truncate-->

### Compile AirSim

#### Preparation

Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), and make sure to include **Desktop Development with C++** and **Windows 10 SDK >= 10.0.18362** (usually selected by default).

#### Start Compilation

1. Clone AirSim to your local machine by using `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim.git`.
2. Use **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019** to navigate to the AirSim directory and run `build.cmd`.

## Create Unreal Project

> [Microsoft Official Tutorial and Explanation](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/unreal_custenv/)

While AirSim comes with the "Blocks Environment" that can be used, we will opt to create our own Unreal Environment.

- In Epic Games Launcher, go to "Learn" and download "Landscape Mountains" (or any other environment of your choice).

- Click on `File`, create a new `C++ Class` with the default name.

- Copy `%PATH%/AirSim/Unreal/Plugins` to your project directory.

  > If you cannot locate the Plugins, run `update_to_git.bat` in the `%PATH%/AirSim/Unreal/Environments\Blocks` directory using Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019.

- Edit `%Projects%.uproject`, add `AdditionalDependencies` and `Plugins`, so your file should look like this:

  ```json
  {
    "FileVersion": 3,
    "EngineAssociation": "4.27",
    "Category": "Samples",
    "Description": "",
    "Modules": [
      {
        "Name": "LandscapeMountains",
        "Type": "Runtime",
        "LoadingPhase": "Default",
        "AdditionalDependencies": ["AirSim"]
      }
    ],
    "TargetPlatforms": ["MacNoEditor", "WindowsNoEditor"],
    "Plugins": [
      {
        "Name": "AirSim",
        "Enabled": true
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- Right-click on the `%Project%.uproject` file and select `Generate Visual Studio Project Files`.
- Open `%Project%.sln` file using VS, choose "DebugGame Editor" and "Win64" as build configurations, and run the project.
- You should now be able to use AirSim in your own Unreal environment; remember to save your settings!

# Run Python API

In this section, I am using Conda + Python 3.8 environment.

Begin by installing the required packages:

```
 pip install msgpack-rpc-python
 pip install airsim
```

Start with basic drone controls.

> First, obtain the drone Client for API control and remember to unlock the drone.

Use `.join()` to control the drone with `Async` methods to ensure one action completes before the next one begins.

Here is a simple example:

```python
import airsim

client = airsim.MultirotorClient()  # Connect to the drone
client.enableApiControl(True)       # Gain control
client.armDisarm(True)              # Unlock
client.takeoffAsync().join()        # Take off
client.landAsync(),join()           # Land
client.armDisarm(False)
client.enableApiControl(False)
```
