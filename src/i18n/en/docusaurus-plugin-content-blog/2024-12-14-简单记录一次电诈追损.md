It feels like being scammed when buying virtual goods is not a one-time thing; I've been scammed by thunder strikes, pig-killing scams, and more...

Recently, Bird Soul collaborated with Idol Master, so I wanted to find a proxy to recharge a few yen. The ones I used before were gone, so I looked for a new one.

## 12/1

I'm pretty clear about the proxy recharge process, so I usually calculate that anything above 70% is stable. But a quick search for a certain fish showed most were 88%~95%, which felt like pure loss. Since the CS system has changed, I really didn't want to waste days flipping goods myself, so I hoped to find a shop with a lower rate. Suddenly, I saw one at 63%, looked fake at first glance, but with hundreds of reviews and almost no bad ones, plus instant replies while others didn't, so I went for it. Charged about 150$, not much, and I expected some risk.

## 12/5

A few days later, my Bird Soul account was banned. After checking with customer service, I found it was refunded. Looking at the shop's reviews, most were banned in those days. So I started to seek compensation from Bird Soul, and also tried to get help from salted fish, and found others in the review section who were also banned and formed a group to report to the police.

Then came the classic runaround. I didn't report to the police immediately because I had no official seller info. Salted fish customer service first asked me to report, then to file a complaint about the order. I spent 18:00-19:30 dealing with this, benefited from salted fish's amazing 3-minute survival mechanism and the low efficiency of customer service, so I repeated every message at least three times.

Finally, customer service helped me submit the report, and I started to file complaints for compensation.

## 12/6~12/7

Chasing compensation required a lot of info. I laid out all the evidence in detail, and four orders needed supplementary materials on the second and third days.

This supplementary info required uploading videos to non-mainstream platforms (Youku, Tencent, iQIYI), and the video had to show all the evidence I submitted. So I spent half an afternoon recording videos and tried to find the upload button on those three platforms, finally managed to submit.

## 12/8~12/9

On the fifth day, the four orders started to get refund notifications. But the first day was only platform notification, the second to fourth days were phone calls, no extra measures.

## 12/11~12/12

The seller seemed to refund the previous orders, but my ban came later, and the process added a second review, so when it got to me, he tried to negotiate: "No money, half and half." I naturally refused. At this point, he realized "even if I don't refund, it doesn't matter," because salted fish just calls him every day, doesn't notify the police or related contacts, and the only penalty is "credit score -2," not even account banâ€”because he hasn't compensated all claims.

After this, the seller started verbally attacking me, then disappeared. I had little hope for compensation.

A few group members reported to the police, but little progress. Big claims got refunded, small ones ignored. If you want to pursue, you have to go to the case location or the seller's location to report, and joint reports don't reach the threshold for a case.

## 12/13

But anyway, I still submitted info exposure requests to salted fish, submitted a bunch of materials as always, and started review.

At the same time, I started reporting to the police. By now, it had been a week since the ban, and honestly, I had no patience left. Too many things, time cost not worth it. The police handled it quickly, though the Beijing accent at the station was strong, but what they said made sense: "Don't bother with salted fish for compensation, just say you were scammed, that's enough, salted fish customer service is useless."

But the station's efficiency wasn't high. I was third in line at 1pm, but didn't get processed until 4:30pm (didn't eat lunch, takeout was cold), and several officers chatted about a BUPT student scammed for 648 RMB (yes, a very coincidental number), laughing as they talked, which was a bit awkward.

Honestly, I wanted to leave several times while waiting. I felt my time, money, and effort would be better spent buying a flower ring and sending it away. I already expected the process to be inefficient, but was still interested in seeing how long it would take, whether the evidence would be enough, and even doubted if a clearly identified telecom fraud would be handled (especially at year-end).

COPs first asked about the general situation, then after seeing my info exposure, took a photo and sent me to the small black room for operations. I couldn't get through on the phone, but after about fifteen minutes, COPs let me in for a face-to-face, probably just checked my latest phone number. But to be fair, the attitude changed immediately: "Okay, probably just missed the refund request," and quickly refunded me.

Anyway, since I was there, I still insisted on going through the whole process, and tried to file an administrative violation case, so if other group members want to report and chase compensation, they can use the venue.

The process was simple, but basically repeated the same questions as at the start, just with more details, needing order numbers and personal info. After filling out, you need to sign every page, and write a statement to prove the facts, then fill out the execution part, and wait another thirty minutes.
