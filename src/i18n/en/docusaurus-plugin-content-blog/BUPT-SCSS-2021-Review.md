## 01 Introduction to Network Security - Basic Theories and Technical Framework

### Cyberspace

The **fifth space** following sea, land, air, and space.

A dynamic virtual space that includes various computing systems, networks, hardware and software, data, and information.

### Cyberspace Security

Research on the threats and defense measures faced by **information**, **networks**, and **systems** in the process of producing, transmitting, storing, and processing information.

### Key Characteristics of Information Security

#### *Confidentiality*

An inherent quality of information security.

Ensures that information cannot be accessed without authorization, and even if accessed without authorization, it cannot be used.

#### *Integrity*

Ensures the consistency of information.

Guarantees that information does not undergo unauthorized alterations, whether intentional or unintentional, during generation, transmission, storage, and processing.

#### *Availability*

Ensures the ability to provide services at any time.

Guarantees that information can be accessed by authorized users whenever needed.

#### Non-repudiation

Ensures the truthfulness of information.

Guarantees that information cannot be denied by users after it has been generated, issued, or received.

#### Controllability

Monitoring of information and information systems.

Control of information dissemination and content.

## 02 Introduction to Network Security - Cryptography V2

### Components of Cryptographic Systems

#### Plaintext

The original form of information.

#### Ciphertext

The result of encoding plaintext.

#### Encryption Algorithm

The process of encoding plaintext is called **encryption**, and the rules of encoding are called **encryption algorithms**.

#### Decryption Algorithm

The process of recovering plaintext from ciphertext is called **decryption**, and the rules of recovery are called **decryption algorithms**.

#### Key

Controls the mutual conversion between plaintext and ciphertext, divided into *encryption key* and *decryption key*.

### Classification of Cryptographic Systems

#### Based on Data Processing Characteristics

- Block Ciphers: Encrypt data on a block-by-block basis.
- Stream Ciphers: Encrypt data bit by bit.

#### Based on Development Stage of Cryptography

- Traditional Ciphers (Classical Ciphers)
  - Substitution Ciphers: Shuffle the order of plaintext (e.g., rotor cipher).
  - Transposition Ciphers: Change the letters of plaintext (e.g., Caesar cipher).
- Modern Ciphers

#### Based on Cryptographic Characteristics

- Symmetric Ciphers
- Asymmetric Ciphers (Public Key Cryptography)

> Block ciphers and stream ciphers can be regarded as subclasses of symmetric encryption.

### Elements Required by Cryptographic Devices

Security, performance, ease of use, cost.

### Design Principles of Block Ciphers and Their Meanings

#### Confusion

Complex relationship between the key, ciphertext, and plaintext to thwart cryptanalysis.

#### Diffusion

Each bit of plaintext affects many bits of ciphertext to hide statistical properties of plaintext.

Each bit of the key affects many bits of ciphertext to prevent cracking the key bit by bit.

### Enigma Cipher Machine

#### Plugboard

Increased complexity of the key space.

#### Rotors

Increased algorithm complexity.

#### Reflector

Same encryption and decryption algorithm.

#### Daily Key

Key encrypts the key.

#### Session Key

Session-specific key.

#### Codebook

Central to the system.

Security depends on the key.

#### Five Elements

- **Plaintext**: Original text.
- **Ciphertext**: Encrypted text.
- **Encryption Algorithm**: Single-table substitution + multi-table substitution.
- **Decryption Algorithm**: Same as encryption algorithm.
- **Key**: Plugboard settings, rotor arrangement, rotor positions.

### DES Encryption Algorithm

Block cipher that divides plaintext into **64 bits**, uses a **56-bit key** to generate **48-bit subkeys**, encrypts each 64-bit plaintext block with subkeys to produce 64-bit ciphertext.

#### Subkey Generation Algorithm

Simple and fast to generate.

Each bit of the key has roughly the same influence on each bit of the subkey.

#### Round Function

- **Non-linearity**: Reflects algorithm complexity.
- **Reversibility**: Enables decryption.
- **Avalanche Effect**

### Requirements for Sequence Passwords' Password Sequence Generators

- Long seed key length
- Maximum period
- Randomness
- Irreversibility
- Avalanche effect
- Password sequence unpredictability (knowing the first half should not predict the second half)

### Symmetric Encryption

#### Advantages

Fast computation speed.

Relatively short key length.

No data expansion.

#### Disadvantages

Difficult key distribution.

Large number of keys to be kept secret, difficult to maintain.

Difficult to achieve digital signature and authentication functions.

### Public Key Cryptography

#### Significance

**Public key cryptography** is a hallmark of modern cryptography and is the largest and only true revolution in the history of cryptography.

#### Idea

Encryption key is the **public key**.

Decryption key is the **private key**.

#### Advantages

Easy key distribution.

Small amount of secret keys to be kept secret.

Ability to implement digital signature and authentication functions.

#### Disadvantages

Slow computational speed.

Long key length.

Data expansion.

> Regarding Hash and Authentication: Without a certificate, the identity of the party obtaining the public key cannot be confirmed.

### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

#### Scheme

Publicly agree on *p* and *g*.

Alice and Bob each choose a number *a* and *b*.

Compute `g^a mod p = Ka` and `g^b mod p = Kb` to exchange.

`Ka^b mod p = Kb^a mod p = K` is the key.

**Achievement**

Solved an *impossible problem*.

**Limitations**

Must be online simultaneously.

### RSA Public Key Cryptography

#### One-way Trapdoor Function

Given P and M, calculating C = P(M) is easy.

Given C but not S, calculating M is difficult.

Given C and S, calculating M is easy.

#### Algorithm

- Select two large prime numbers, *p* and *q*.
- Calculate *n=p*q*.
- Select *e* such that gcd(e,φ(n))=1.
- d*e ≡1 (mod φ(n)).

Keep *p* and *q* secret.

*e* and *n* are public keys.

*d* is the private key.

Encryption Algorithm: C = E(M) ≡ M^e (mod n).

Decryption Algorithm: M = D(C) ≡ C^d (mod n).

#### Summary

- The *first practical public key algorithm*.
- The *most widely used* public key encryption algorithm.
- RSA's theoretical basis is Euler's theorem in number theory.
- RSA's security relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.
- Neither **proof nor denial** of RSA's security by cryptanalysts.
- Can be used for *encryption* and *digital signatures*.
- Currently, a *1024-bit key length* is considered secure.

### Key Distribution Based on Public Key Cryptography

### DoS

#### Meaning

Denial of Service Attack.

A destructive attack method that **prevents** or **denies** legitimate users from accessing network services.

#### Principle

**Normal TCP three-way handshake**:

- ->SYN request
- <-SYN/ACK response
- ->ACK packet

**DoS Attack**:

- Sending a SYN with a fake IP source address.
- Server responds with SYN/ACK to the fake IP and waits for an ACK.
- No response, server retries and waits.

**DDoS**:

Using a botnet to distribute denial of service attacks.

- **Detection**: Scanning for vulnerable hosts.
- **Injection**: Planting a trojan on vulnerable hosts.
- **Control**: Choosing MasterServer, placing a guardian program.
- **Command**: Sending attack signal to other hosts.
- **Execution**: Other hosts begin attacking.
- **Outcome**: Target system flooded with fake requests, unable to respond to legitimate user requests.

### APT Attacks

#### Definition

### Zero-Knowledge Proof

Proving a statement is true without revealing any useful information to V.

> Alice tells Bob she has the key to the room but doesn't show the key.
>
> Instead, she shows an item that's only found inside the room, making Bob believe she has the key without actually seeing it.

### Password Authentication Based on Hash Functions

#### Benefits

- Passwords are not stored anywhere.
- Passwords are stored as hash values.
- Passwords are not known by the administrator.

#### Password Change

1. Encrypt the new password hash value using the original password's hash value as the key.
2. Decrypt the hash value of the original password in the database to obtain the hash value of the new password.
3. Replace the hash value.

#### ~~Single-way Authentication Based on Certificates~~ (Not clear)

1. A generates Ks, rA, encrypts Ks using B's public key, signs rA, IDA, IDB, gives the encrypted Ks, A's certificate, and signature to B.
2. B verifies A's certificate to get A's public key, verifies the validity of S to authenticate A, decrypts the ciphertext to get Ks using the private key.
3. B selects rB, encrypts rB with Ks to send to A.
