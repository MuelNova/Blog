# Introduction

I always felt that my blog was too plain, so I wanted to add a virtual waifu or something similar. When I tried to use HEXO-live2d, I found out that it only supports the Cubism2 version of Live2D, and the same goes for others (it seems to be due to commercial copyright issues according to the Issues I checked). I found this SDK on the official website and decided to give it a try by `ctrl+c` `ctrl+v`, and surprisingly, it worked! :P

# Preparation

1. [Live2D Cubism SDK for Web](https://www.live2d.com/download/cubism-sdk/download-web/)

2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/)

3. TypeScript

   `npm install -g typescript`

# Getting Started with Customization

### Test Steps

Navigate to the `\CubismSdkForWeb-x\Samples\TypeScript\Demo` folder and run the following commands in the command line:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

The official recommendation is to use Visual Studio. The commands may have slight differences, for details please refer to [Github](https://github.com/Live2D/CubismWebSamples/blob/develop/Samples/TypeScript/README.md).

This process will compile and generate a `bundle.js` in the `\dist\` folder, which will be used to load the Live2D model in the `index.html`.

Unless specified otherwise, all following paths are assumed to be inside the `\CubismSdkForWeb-x\Samples\TypeScript\Demo` folder.

### Importing Your Own Model

Open the `\src\lappdefine.ts` file and locate the following code:

```typescript
export const ResourcesPath = "../../Resources/";

// Model definition---------------------------------------------
// Array of directories where the models are located
// Ensure directory names match model3.json names
export const ModelDir: string[] = ["Haru", "Hiyori", "Mark", "Natori", "Rice"];
```

Here, the locations of various Live2D models are defined. To import your model, place it in the `ResourcesPath` mentioned in the code, which by default is `\CubismSdkForWeb-4-r.3\Samples\Resources\`, and add the model name to the `ModelDir` array.

**It is important** to rename the `.model3.json` file to match the folder name.

For example, if you place a `Nova` model in the resources folder with the directory structure as follows:

```plaintext
|
├─Nova
│  │  86.cdi3.json
│  │  86.moc3
│  │  Nova.model3.json
│  │  86.physics3.json
│  │  cc_86.cfg
│  │
│  └─86.4096
│          texture_00.png
├─Other_Models
```

Rename `86.model3.json` to `Nova.model3.json`. Your directory structure should now look like this:

```plaintext
|
├─Nova
│  │  86.cdi3.json
│  │  86.moc3
│  │  Nova.model3.json
│  │  86.physics3.json
│  │  cc_86.cfg
│  │
│  └─86.4096
│          texture_00.png
├─Other_Models
```

Ensure that the `ModelDir` array in your `\src\lappdefine.ts` file also includes `"Nova"`.

Recompile and run the local server. You should now see the imported model in action.

> You can use third-party tools like Visual Studio or WebStorm to open the local server, or run `npm run start` in the command line and open the provided link to preview the `Demo` folder.

## Modifying Model Movement to Follow Mouse

By default, the Live2D waifu in the SDK only follows when the left/right mouse button is pressed. We will modify it to follow the mouse movement.

Open the `\src\lappdelegate.ts` file, find the following code:

```typescript
const supportTouch: boolean = "ontouchend" in canvas;

if (supportTouch) {
  // Touch-related callback function registration
  canvas.ontouchstart = onTouchBegan;
  canvas.ontouchmove = onTouchMoved;
  canvas.ontouchend = onTouchEnded;
  canvas.ontouchcancel = onTouchCancel;
} else {
  // Mouse-related callback function registration
  canvas.onmousedown = onClickBegan;
  canvas.onmousemove = onMouseMoved;
  canvas.onmouseup = onClickEnded;
}
```

Comment out and add the mouse movement event:

```typescript
document.addEventListener("mousemove", function (e) {
  const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  const posX: number = e.clientX - rect.left;
  const posY: number = e.clientY - rect.top;
  LAppDelegate.getInstance()._view.onTouchesMoved(posX, posY);
});
// Essentially a copy of onMouseMoved()
```

You may notice that clicking actions no longer work. Hence, add back the `onmouseup` event:

Add below the previous code:

```typescript
canvas.onmouseup = onClickEnded;

// Added an event to reset position when mouse is out of the browser for aesthetics
document.addEventListener("mouseout", function (e) {
  const live2DManager: LAppLive2DManager = LAppLive2DManager.getInstance();
  live2DManager.onDrag(0.0, 0.0);
});
```

After testing, the functionality should be restored.

## Drawing on Canvas

To remove the background from the canvas, open `\src\lappview.ts` and comment out the image creation method:

```typescript
public initializeSprite(): void {
    const width: number = canvas.width;
    const height: number = canvas.height;

    const textureManager = LAppDelegate.getInstance().getTextureManager();
    const resourcesPath = LAppDefine.ResourcesPath;

    /*let imageName = '';

    // Initialize background image
    imageName = LAppDefine.BackImageName;

    // Asynchronous, so create a callback function
    const initBackGroundTexture = (textureInfo: TextureInfo): void => {
      const x: number = width * 0.5;
      const y: number = height * 0.5;

      const fwidth = textureInfo.width * 2.0;
      const fheight = height * 0.95;
      this._back = new LAppSprite(x, y, fwidth, fheight, textureInfo.id);
    };

    textureManager.createTextureFromPngFile(
      resourcesPath + imageName,
      false,
      initBackGroundTexture
    );

    // Initialize gear image
    imageName = LAppDefine.GearImageName;
    const initGearTexture = (textureInfo: TextureInfo): void => {
      const x = width - textureInfo.width * 0.5;
      const y = height - textureInfo.height * 0.5;
      const fwidth = textureInfo.width;
      const fheight = textureInfo.height;
      this._gear = new LAppSprite(x, y, fwidth, fheight, textureInfo.id);
    };

    textureManager.createTextureFromPngFile(
      resourcesPath + imageName,
      false,
      initGearTexture
    );*/

	/*if (this._gear.isHit(pointX, pointY)) {
      live2DManager.nextScene();
    }*/

```

For a transparent background, open `\src\lappdelegate.ts` and set the background alpha to `0`:

```typescript
  public run(): void {
    // Main loop
    const loop = (): void => {
      // Check for instance existence
      if (s_instance == null) {
        return;
      }

      // Update time
      LAppPal.updateTime();

      // Initialize the screen
      gl.clearColor(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0); // Change alpha from 1.0 to 0.0
```

Next is a customization of the Live2D model layout, where the Live2D 2.x version's [Live2D](https://github.com/galnetwen/Live2D) project was directly reused.

> The `js/live2d.js` in this project is the `bundle.js` in the `dist` directory, so some modifications should be made to the `demo.html`.

## Final Modifications

Open `\src\lappdelegate.ts` and adjust the `canvas` in the `initialize()` method:

```typescript
public initialize(): boolean {
    // Create the canvas
    // canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    canvas = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById('live2d'); // should correspond to the canvas id in custom_html
    if (LAppDefine.CanvasSize === 'auto') {
      this._resizeCanvas();
    } else {
      // canvas.width = LAppDefine.CanvasSize.width;
      // canvas.height = LAppDefine.CanvasSize.height;
    }
...
	// Add the canvas to the DOM
    //document.body.appendChild(canvas);

  private _resizeCanvas(): void {
    // canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
    // canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
  }

```

Move the cloned `live2d` folder from [Live2D](https://github.com/galnetwen/Live2D) to the `source` folder of Hexo, and place the previously compiled `\dist\bundle.js` and `\CubismSdkForWeb-4-r.3\Core\live2dcubismcore.js` into the `source\live2d\js\` folder. Next, locate the `_config.fluid.yml` file in the root directory of Hexo and find:

```yaml
# Custom HTML content in the <head> section
custom_head:
```

Add the following line from `demo.html` to it:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/live2d/css/live2d.css" />
```

Similarly, under the `custom_html` line, add the following code:

```html
<div id="landlord">
  <div class="message" style="opacity:0"></div>
  <canvas id="live2d" width="280" height="250" class="live2d"></canvas>
  <!-- If you modify the id here, make sure to change the id in the JS as well -->
  <div class="hide-button">Hide</div>
</div>
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://cdn.bootcss.com/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.min.js"
></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var message_Path = "/live2d/";
  var home_Path = "https://haremu.com/"; // You can modify it to your homepage link or remove it
</script>
<!-- Change live2d.js to bundle.js -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="./live2d/js/bundle.js"></script>
<!-- Include live2d core -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="./live2d/js/ive2dcubismcore.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="/live2d/js/message.js"></script>
```

Finally, using the command `hexo clean && hexo g`, you should now be able to see your Live2D character on the blog.

### How to Modify Size and Center Point

After adding the waifu, you might notice it appears very small. To adjust the size, open the `\CubismSdkForWeb-4-r.3\Framework\src\math\cubismmodelmatrix.ts` file and make changes:

```typescript
/**
 * Set the width
 *
 * @param w Width
 */
public setWidth(w: number): void {
  const scaleX: number = w / this._width;
  const scaleY: number = scaleX;
  this.scale(scaleX*2, scaleY*2); // Multiply as needed to enlarge
}

/**
 * Set the height
 * @param h Height
 */
public setHeight(h: number): void {
  const scaleX: number = h / this._height;
  const scaleY: number = scaleX;
  this.scale(scaleX*2, scaleY*2); // Multiply as needed to enlarge
}
```

Recompile `bundle.js`, place it in the `source\live2d\js\` folder, and redeploy Hexo to make it effective.

### Epilogue

Simple modifications may not make the waifu perfect. You may encounter issues like **incomplete model display**, **lack of interactivity**, or **weird mouse following**. The solution is to customize the source code as mentioned above. Due to limited resources, it's challenging to cover every aspect comprehensively (after all, the waifu has been deployed for several months when writing this blog).

You can study the project already done by [the master](https://github.com/cqc233/live2dDemo) to find solutions to most of the aforementioned problems, as they have added many custom methods to enhance the waifu experience, even achieving plug-and-play operation (they even have blogs and videos, so compared to my detailed explanation, I wonder where I'm going with this detailed blog~~where is the significance of spending so much time on writing this blog~~). You can visit [the star-gazing sun](https://space.bilibili.com/42800229) to find out more.

~~The purpose of human existence is to constantly reinvent the wheel!~~
