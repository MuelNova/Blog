# How to Modify Local Saves to Server Saves in Palworld

## Before You Start

Please make sure you have some hands-on abilities. Based on the assumption that you can open a server, the following text will assume that readers will use Python3 and be familiar with using the terminal.

### Prerequisites

- Python3
- [MuelNova/Palworld-Save-Patcher](https://github.com/MuelNova/Palworld-Save-Patcher)
- Prepare the save to be converted, referred to as `%SAVE%` in this guide, it should be similar to the structure below

```plaintext
%SAVE%
├── LevelMeta.sav
├── Level.sav
├── LocalData.sav
├── Players
│   ├── 00000000000000000000000000000001.sav
│   ├── PLAYER_B_GUID.sav
│   └── PLAYER_C_GUID.sav
└── WorldOption.sav
```

### Version Information (Current as of)

- Palworld v0.1.2.0
- Server deployment using https://github.com/thijsvanloef/palworld-server-docker

## Modification Process

### Extracting Server Saves

Ensure that your server is up and running and copy the entire `%SAVE%` to the server saves location.

The original homeowner logs into the game, which should prompt the creation of a new user. Proceed to create a new user and perform some actions before exiting the game.

At this point, a new file should appear in the `%SAVE%/Players` folder, representing the GUID of each STEAM user, identified as `0D000721000000000000000000000001.sav`.

```plaintext
%SAVE%
├── LevelMeta.sav
├── Level.sav
├── LocalData.sav
├── Players
│   ├── 00000000000000000000000000000001.sav
│   ├── PLAYER_B_GUID.sav
│   ├── 0D000721000000000000000000000001.sav
│   └── PLAYER_C_GUID.sav
└── WorldOption.sav
```

In this case, `0D000721000000000000000000000001` is the GUID of the original homeowner.

**Shutdown the server**, and make sure you have backed up the `%SAVE%` folder.

### Running the Script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuelNova/Palworld-Save-Patcher.git
cd Palworld-Save-Patcher
python script.py fix-host %SAVE% %GUID%
# Replace with your own values
# python script.py fix-host /home/nova/test_pal 0D000721000000000000000000000001
```

### Restart the Server

The original homeowner should now have progress in the game; however, the name and guild no longer exist. You need to join a friend's server to see them. This is a small flaw (due to these details being stored in BYTE, making it inconvenient to modify).

## Principles

This part can be skipped if not interested.

### Analysis of Save Files

Located in `%applocaldadta%\Pal\Saved\SavedGame\<STEAM_ID>\<WORLD_ID>`

#### LocalData.sav

Contains map data, unrelated to users. Can be directly copied to other saves to skip the map opening process.

#### Level.sav

Critical file that stores all resources, their owners, and map events.

#### Player/xxxxxx.sav

Player files

### .sav Files

> Currently, only the modification method is known, without the actual principle. Refer to [Converting Palworld saves to JSON and back (github.com)](https://gist.github.com/cheahjs/300239464dd84fe6902893b6b9250fd0) for more information.

For a `.sav` file, it is not a standard UE .sav file header but a file compressed using `zlib` (or double compressed).

- `[0:4]` is the uncompressed size
- `[4:8]` is the compressed size
- `[8:11]` is a fixed magic number "PlZ"
- `[11]` represents a type, with possible values: `0x30, 0x31, 0x32`. `0x30` is unused, `0x31` is for single zlib compression, and `0x32` for double zlib compression
- `[12:]` is the compressed data

After decompression, a GVAS file is obtained, which can be converted to a JSON file using tools like [trumank/uesave-rs: Rust library to read and write Unreal Engine save files (github.com)](https://github.com/trumank/uesave-rs).

```bash
uesave to-json --input <GUID>.sav.gvas --output <GUID>.sav.json
```
