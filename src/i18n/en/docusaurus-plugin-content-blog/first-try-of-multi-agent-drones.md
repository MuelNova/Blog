# Attempt of Drone Swarm

# Configure settings.json file

Configure the following fields in `settings.json`

<!--truncate-->

```json
  "Vehicles": {
    "UAV1": {
      "VehicleType": "SimpleFlight",
      "X": 0,
      "Y": 0,
      "Z": 0,
      "Yaw": 0
    },
    "UAV2": {
      "VehicleType": "SimpleFlight",
      "X": 2,
      "Y": 0,
      "Z": 0,
      "Yaw": 0
    },
    "UAV3": {
      "VehicleType": "SimpleFlight",
      "X": -2,
      "Y": 0,
      "Z": 0,
      "Yaw": 0
    }
  }
```

Get the list of drones in `Python`

```python
drones = client.listVehicles()
```

As the drone swarm needs to operate collaboratively, we cannot use `.join()` method on all actions as in the previous sections. If we do so, the drones will perform actions one by one. However, if none of the drones have the `.join()` method, the subsequent actions will not run properly.

Here is the solution I came up with:

> Check if it is the last drone, then add it to the `Future` class, so that all subsequent actions will wait for it to finish before proceeding.
```python
for i in drones:
    print(drones)
    if i == drones[-1]:
        client.takeoffAsync(vehicle_name=i).join()
    else:
        client.takeoffAsync(vehicle_name=i)
```
