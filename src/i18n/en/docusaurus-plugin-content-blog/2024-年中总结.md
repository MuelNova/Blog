Unconsciously, half of 2024 has already passed. There are many things worth recording in this past half year.

Traffic alert.

## Daily Accounts

Thanks to OneDrive and the gradually developed habit of keeping records, we have more things to write about.

### January

Went home! Karaoke with friends! Other than that, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much else. At that time, I was probably still healing my emotional wounds (just kidding).

### February

Went back to my hometown for the holidays. I vaguely remember writing a rather long essay.

![IMG20240209222124](https://oss.nova.gal/img/IMG20240209222124.jpg)

Played mahjong with friends, casually made a four concealed pungs (a complex hand in mahjong).

Took a family portrait at my brother's photography studio, but he kept making me laugh :(

Went skiing! Skied twice, and now I'm a skiing master (meaning I learned how to do single-board falling leaf).

Bought some cool peripherals and quickly sold them (this keyboard is unacceptable for a programmer).

### March

In March, I drank all night with classmates twice, haha, true wild men.

I have to admit, Beijing's blue hour is quite beautiful.

![IMG_20240317_055931](https://oss.nova.gal/img/IMG_20240317_055931.jpg)

Went to Hangzhou to participate in the West Lake Debate.

### April

Starting from April, it seems like I was preparing for summer camps, so I didn't do much this month.

### May

The big one!

In May, I passionately participated in the Arknights Carnival and the Symphony Joint. I have a thousand photos but will share my favorite one; he looks so good.

![d2682c32-7abd-4a12-af2c-e9239fe218fe1714874912337](https://oss.nova.gal/img/d2682c32-7abd-4a12-af2c-e9239fe218fe1714874912337.jpeg)

Visited Line 2 Ark Corridor, met with online friends, ate together, and got massages. Very good memories.

This is also my first time taking a photo with a Coser. Haha, I hope next time I can take a photo without wearing a mask.

Additionally, I had desserts with classmates for the first time and had my first parfait, but it wasn't as good as I imagined.

### June

Went shopping with classmates in the "Canon Official Store."

![IMG20240606190439](https://oss.nova.gal/img/IMG20240606190439.jpg)

Went to Shanghai again, had a meal with team seniors, and visited my dream school, Fudan University (didn't get into the summer camp, haha).

![IMG20240609114052](https://oss.nova.gal/img/IMG20240609114052.jpg)

A photo taken after 6 years; pardon my messy look at my junior high school graduation; took it however it came.

![41690df83c381b2ce47bbea0933477dd](https://oss.nova.gal/img/41690df83c381b2ce47bbea0933477dd.jpeg)

Participated in the summer camp at Peking University, highly praised the restroom in Li Yi, and enjoyed the food at Peking University. Unfortunately, I didn't finish spending the given money, haha.

![IMG20240628124351](https://oss.nova.gal/img/IMG20240628124351.jpg)

Lastly, had a graduation exchange with lab seniors and visited Tsinghua University.

![IMG20240629164757](https://oss.nova.gal/img/IMG20240629164757.jpg)

Worth noting, Dean Tan used his student card to spend a fortune on a Tsinghua University automatic umbrella for me, which turned out to be color-faded.

## Data

At the beginning of this year, I activated a life management system to record my life's data. Although I slacked off after April, there are still some interesting things to see.

### January

#### Monthly Report

This is the first monthly report. Unfortunately, as it just started, there isn't much to say, and nothing substantial can be seen from the data. I didn't even know how to write a monthly report, so let's just leave it at that.

Regarding the progress this month: first, I finished the final exams, then prepared a paper presentation and experimented with this new life management system. Human relations were not very successful, but everything else was quite good. Keep it up.

#### Data

### February

#### Monthly Report

Due to the new year celebrations, almost all plans were disrupted. OKR2 was almost not completed, and OKR1 was barely completed.

Next month, I need to add a new OKR for the postgraduate recommendation. I hope other OKRs can also be completed with quality.

#### O1KR1

Go to bed early? Failed. The earliest average for a month was 01:30, haha.

#### O1KR2

Early rise, barely reached the passing line (not really), meaning getting up within 15 minutes of waking up. Actually, I often sleep an extra 30 minutes or more, but getting up directly a few times pulled the average up.

#### O1KR3

Meditation, this failed quickly, I can't do it. Meditating after waking up in the morning is just sleeping.

#### O1KR4

Exercise. Due to the summer camps for postgraduate recommendation, this failed halfway. Currently, I am gradually restoring it...

#### O2

The learning Object, including specialties, literature, and language, and all of them failed, not surprisingly.

#### O3

Object for postgraduate recommendation to train algorithms. Big success, I finished the basic algorithm course on AcWing and continuously practiced LeetCode for nearly 3 months! (‡πë‚Ä¢ÃÄ„ÖÇ‚Ä¢ÃÅ)Ÿà‚úß‚ùÄ

## Reflections and New Plans

With the summer camps coming to an end, life can gradually return to normal.

In the next half year, I will participate in offline research activities and save money for a Japan trip by the end of the year.

Meanwhile, I will resume physical exercise activities.

Most importantly, I will complete the practical study of compilers and computer networks (hardware-oriented).

For this, I will set new OKRs in the coming days.

Over the past six months, I've become more comfortable in managing interpersonal relationships and gradually moved towards "self-love", which is undoubtedly a good thing.

Over the past six months, I can hardly think of any particularly sad incidents. Does this mean I am becoming more optimistic? Undoubtedly, I quite like the current version of myself, haha.
