# TeamSpeak3 Self-built Server Using Domain Name to Replace IP

## Preparation

- A server with [Teamspeak3 Server](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads/#server) already installed
- A domain name

<!--truncate-->

## Steps (Using [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) DNS Control as an Example)

### 1. Add an A Record
- Fill in the `Name` with the host header (For example, if I want to use `ts.n.ova.moe` to log into Teamspeak for my domain [n.ova.moe](https://n.ova.moe), then fill in `ts`)
- Fill in the `Value` with the corresponding server IP (the IP originally used to log into Teamspeak)

### 2. Add an SRV Record
- Use `_ts3` as the Service
- Use `_udp` as the Protocol
- Use the `host header` filled in step 1 as the Name
- Use the **full domain name** as the Target
- Use the Teamspeak port as the Port (default is `9987`)
- Set `Weight` to 5, `Priority` to 0 (or 1)
- You can set the TTL to 1800 seconds, as this is the refresh duration for the ts3 server

After saving the settings, your two records should look like this: (please replace the content with your own)

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| A | ts | 127.0.0.1 | 3600 seconds | 
| SRV | _ts3._udp.ts | 0 5 9987 ts.n.ova.moe | 1800 seconds |

## Mission Accomplished
Now, you can try to connect to Teamspeak using the domain name you set up!
If it fails, you can wait for about half an hour and try connecting again.

## Some Notes
I have no idea either, hehe
