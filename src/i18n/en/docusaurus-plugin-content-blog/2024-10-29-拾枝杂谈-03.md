Seeing this title, you might wonder: What is Branch Talk? Isn't it something from Genshin Impact? Why is it already 03, where did the first two go?

My answer is, I don't know either. Today, when flipping through my 2021 class notes for a junior, I unexpectedly found this incomplete backup of an old article on my hard drive.

No mistake, I've changed my blog many times. Started with WordPress, then Hexo, maybe a few jumps in between, but finally switched to Docusaurus in 2022/11. Although I copied my old blog when switching to Docusaurus, three years ago, in order to "improve literary quality," I put some articles on another blog framework. Unfortunately, I clearly couldn't use OneDrive properly back then (actually, I still can't now), so these texts gradually disappeared in the data flood of "changing devices / formatting hard drives."

Three years isn't far, but it's like starlight—within reach, yet untouchable. The brightness of each star is different; we always remember the brighter ones, but habitually ignore the ordinary ones until one day they quietly fade away. Luckily, thanks to helping a junior find notes, I focused on this very ordinary star in the galaxy.

By timeline, it should have been on my desktop at home, but probably got transferred to my 2021 Y9000P during a backup, and finally, without noticing, followed the hard drive swap and miraculously survived on my current desktop's mechanical drive.

> Home has always been unrestrained, especially during winter and summer breaks. I can immerse myself in music, dive into games, or imagine a world that belongs only to me—maybe that's how I spend my loneliness.
>
> So, I really have no reason why I went out that day. Of course, I'll never know, this world is just full of such mysteries (ふかかい).
>
> But I didn't make an appointment with friends, nor did I have any purpose—I truly don't know why I went out. Anyway, I just sat on those empty fitness machines in the park, swiping my phone, switching apps aimlessly. The weather was clear, and suddenly, there appeared such an aimless idler.

> No one would be curious about a middle schooler playing on a fitness machine at 3pm on a workday—not even the security guard. This is a public place, and I'm just an idler who shouldn't be here but showed up anyway.

> But you started a conversation with me.

> I've always been awkward with strangers. I didn't even learn basic communication like discussing products with shop staff until after high school.
>
> Maybe I was too flustered, or maybe I really didn't expect you to talk to me, so I ignored you at first, until I confirmed three times you were talking to me and there was nothing under my seat, then I slowly looked up.
>
> “Did you get the wrong person?”
>
> “No, not at all. Actually, I don't know you, just saw you sitting here alone for a long time and got curious. Are you waiting for someone?”
>
> Maybe because you were standing in the backlight, I can't remember what you looked like.
>
> “Just bored at home for too long, came out to clear my mind.” Even as I replied, my hand kept swiping the screen, not daring to look at you, just wondering when you'd leave.
>
> “Really? But I see you just sitting here watching videos, doesn't seem much different.”
>
> “Can't imagine someone working out alone here, so silly.”
>
> You laughed. I clearly remember your laugh, but can't recall your face.
>

> So strange.
