It's been a while since I last posted on the blog. I recently got a Mac and encountered this issue—here’s how to fix it.

In short, macOS Cloud Storage uses "OneDrive - %ORG_NAME%" as the unique identifier when adding OneDrive accounts. This prevents adding multiple identical accounts, which is quite inconvenient for E5 cloud storage free riders like me.

First, add Account A as usual. Once completed, you should see the corresponding OneDrive folder under `~/Library/CloudStorage`:

Next, **quit all OneDrive applications**, then navigate to:

```
~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac/Data/Library/Application Support/OneDrive/settings/Business1
```

There, you’ll find a file named `GUID.ini`.

If you didn’t install from the App Store, the path will be:

```
~/Library/Application Support/OneDrive/settings/Business1
```

Open that `.ini` file. You’ll see your organization name written there. Change it to whatever you like (for example, "OneDrive - Photos"), making sure it doesn’t match the actual organization name.

Save the file, then relaunch OneDrive. It should report an error saying it can’t find the modified file. Click **Retry**, wait a moment, and then restart OneDrive.

OneDrive should now start syncing normally, and you’ll see the renamed folder:

You can now add another account. The new account will be saved in:

```
~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac/Data/Library/Application Support/OneDrive/settings/Business2
```

From there, repeat the same steps to rename each `BusinessX` folder as needed.
