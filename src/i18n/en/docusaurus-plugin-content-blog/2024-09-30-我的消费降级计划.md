September is my big spending month. Originally, my living expenses dropped sharply due to renting, but I still have to pay for so many things, so I decided to downgrade my consumption.

## Domains

An expensive hobby is buying lots of domains.

- ova.moe: The original main domain, 13.99 USD/year, expires in March next year. I registered many accounts with this domain, so I plan to deal with it this year and not renew next year.
- ouo.sh: Bought but never used, pretty short domain. 27.09 USD, will try to sell it in the second half of the month.
- çº¨.org: Bought but never used, 7.48 USD/year, not expensive, but I don't know why I bought it. If I can't find a use next year, I won't renew.
- zm.md: Currently used for my resume, a two-letter domain is indeed rare. 25.85 USD, will continue to renew.
- nova.gal: My current main domain, a bit expensive at 44.99 USD. But considering "nova" is a premium word and "gal" is quite anime-related, I'll keep renewing.

## Servers

This really bothers me. I currently have a lightweight Alibaba Cloud server in Hong Kong, 34 RMB/month, 408 RMB/year. I don't have much need for servers (my group has servers), just a few static web pages that need public access, and GitHub Pages can auto-deploy, but using a server means I have to write a webhook handler.

Actually, I also have a high-bandwidth Hong Kong server, only 40 RMB/year. But its connectivity is much worse than Alibaba Cloud.

One consideration is "Should I care about domestic users' connectivity when not using a ladder?" Honestly, my blog doesn't get much traffic, and most visitors come from X/Twitter or GitHub and usually have a ladder, so... not a big expense. If I can get 24/month, I'll keep using it. Honestly, having a server on hand is more reassuring.

## Subscriptions

### QQ Membership

The most useless thing. Originally said "5 years of annual super membership for anime," but in reality, I can't even see the anime records. The earliest record is from 2022. Other value-added services are for niche users.

Last year, I subscribed together with Bilibili membership, 178/year.

### Bilibili Membership

Basically don't watch anime on Bilibili anymore, don't need high quality, and if I want to watch something, I'll go to YouTube, so I won't renew.

### Meituan Bike

This is really worth renewing, 16.8\*12 = 201.6/year.

### 1password

Shared rental, 86/year, will renew. I just checked, seems prices are now 25~30, but I just renewed today, will change next year.

### Spotify

Using the Japan region, originally for lyrics, now all regions have lyrics, preparing to switch to the Philippines. Currently 168/year, Philippines is about 84/year.
