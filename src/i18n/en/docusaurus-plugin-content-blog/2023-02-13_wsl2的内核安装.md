title: Record the Process of Changing WSL2 Kernel

I'm about to start looking into Kernel Pwn recently, but it seems that the kernel of WSL2 is not the original one, so I decided to replace it.

<!--truncate-->



## Prerequisites

Make sure you are using WSL2 instead of WSL, and your Windows version meets the requirement of `Windows build 19041 or higher`.



## Check Kernel Version

First, let's check your current kernel version.

I have installed `neofetch`, so I used `neofetch` directly, but you can also use commands like `cat /proc/version` or `uname -a` to check.

The original kernel version is `5.15.79.1`.

## Choose Kernel Version

When I installed WSL2, the Ubuntu version was `22.04.1 LTS`. As of `2023/02/13`, the latest kernel version is `6.1.9`, which is compatible with my Ubuntu version, so I chose to upgrade to the latest version.

:::tip

If there are compatibility issues: for example, if you want to install version 6.X kernel for Ubuntu16, you need to upgrade the Ubuntu version first; otherwise, it won't work.

:::

Download the kernel from [The Linux Kernel Archives](https://www.kernel.org/). I used a [mirror site](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/).

```bash
# Replace the filename and the folder name according to your cases!
curl -LO https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org//pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.1.9.tar.gz
tar xf linux-6.1.9.tar.gz
cd linux-6.1.9
```



## Use WSL2-Linux-Kernel Configuration File

This `.config` file has been adjusted and optimized for `wsl2`. Although the branch was still `linux-msft-wsl-5.15.y` when I installed it, which is compiled for the `5.15` kernel, it still works for the `6.1.9` kernel I installed.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel/linux-msft-wsl-5.15.y/Microsoft/config-wsl >> .config
```



## (Optional) Adjust the Configuration File

I modified the `CONFIG_LOCALVERSION` field in the `.config` file to indicate the kernel characteristics, and you can make more modifications as needed.



## Compile the Kernel

Since we already have the `.config` file, we can just run `make` to compile the kernel.

:::note

Before that, make sure you have installed all the dependencies. You can install them using the following commands.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential flex bison dwarves libssl-dev libelf-dev
# Go to https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel#build-instructions for the latest build dependencies
```

:::

:::tip

Here, adjust the number of jobs based on your own configuration.

My CPU `i7-12700F` has 12 cores and 20 threads, so I can use the `-j20` option.

:::

```bash
sudo make -j20 && sudo make modules -j20 && sudo make modules_install -j20 && sudo make install -j20
```

Before compilation, there will be many configuration options (i.e., new kernel configuration options not specified in the `.config`) that you need to specify. Unless you have specific requirements, you can just press Enter all the way through.



Wait patiently for the installation to finish. You can find a similar field in the standard output indicating the kernel path after `Kernel:`.

```bash
Kernel: arch/x86/boot/bzImage is ready  (#2)
  DESCEND objtool
  DESCEND bpf/resolve_btfids
  CALL    scripts/checksyscalls.sh
  DEPMOD  /lib/modules/6.1.9-linux-standard-WSL2
  INSTALL /boot
```

## Modify the Kernel

Copy it to the desired location. In my case, I copied it to `E:\Ubuntu-2204LTS\linux_kernel_6.1.9`.

:::note

Note that this location should be on your main hard drive, not inside WSL.

:::

```bash
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /mnt/E/Ubuntu-2204LTS/linux_kernel_6.1.9
```

Open your user directory and modify the `.wslconfig` file. Add a `kernel` field under the `[wsl2]` tag, with the value being the Windows path with escaped backslashes.

For example, in my case, the `.wslconfig` file looks like this.

```bash
[wsl2]
kernelCommandLine = vsyscall=emulate
kernel=E:\\Ubuntu-2204LTS\\linux_kernel_6.1.9

[user]
default=root
```



:::tip

You can open your user directory by pressing `Win+R` and entering `%USERPROFILE`. Typically, it is located in `C:\Users\<YOUR_USER_NAME>\`.

:::

:::tip

If the `.wslconfig` file does not exist, then create it.

If the `[wsl2]` tag does not exist, then create it.

:::



## Restart WSL

Now, restart your WSL2 and check the kernel version again.

If everything goes well, your kernel should have been successfully updated.

```bash
wsl --shutdown
wsl
```
