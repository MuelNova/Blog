I've been using a computer for so many years, I have also collected a number of software applications that enhance usability and improve efficiency (and got a cluttered taskbar). Seizing this opportunity to share, with periodic updates.

## [Snipaste](https://www.snipaste.com/)
A software for screenshot and pasting images. I basically use it for screenshots. The magnetic snapping feature is either very useful or annoying at times when you don't want it to snap. Sometimes I directly paste important things (like tasks to remember) onto the desktop, and text can also be pasted. It can also be used for color picking, but I generally do not use it for picking due to the inability to zoom in on pixels for color picking. It consumes around 2.5Mb in the background, which is quite good.

## [kde-connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/)
A software for cross-device collaboration. I mainly use it to sync clipboards between my phone and computer. I don't really use the other multimedia control features, and the device finding feature is usually not helpful for me as kde also fails to connect when I can't find the device (laughs). I have set up some commands between computers to remotely open some things.

## [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/)
This is amazing. It is used to establish P2P connections between multiple devices, allowing software like kde and rdp to connect remotely. I have set up my own Planet server for more stability. Compared to setting up a Moon, it's a bit more complicated, but the performance is much better. If you are in China, you must set up a server before using it, otherwise connecting devices through its own server is basically a nightmare.

## [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/powertoys/)
It should be quite famous. I'll mention a few functions that I use frequently.

### [ColorPicker](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/powertoys/color-picker)
It's a color picking tool that I use often. It has a history record and allows for zoomed-in pixel selection. It can also customize color representation, although I haven't used it. The current features are sufficient for me.

### [Mouse Utilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/powertoys/mouse-utilities)
I mainly use its mouse finding function and highlight feature. The mouse finding is useful for me as I often can't find my mouse while using MWB. Just shaking the mouse can highlight it. The highlight feature is useful for explaining things to others, making it easier for them to understand key points.

### â™¥[Mouse Without Board](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/powertoys/mouse-without-borders)
This feature, together with ZeroTier, allows for remote control. With almost zero delay on the same LAN, you can use a laptop, surface, and desktop as one computer. It also allows for clipboard sharing and file sharing. It's the feature I use the most and it's very convenient.

### [Text Extractor](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/powertoys/text-extractor)
Not much to say, it's basically an integrated OCR, but it is convenient because it's part of PowerToys so you don't need to download a separate software. You can right-click to set the OCR language, and Microsoft's OCR has high accuracy.

## [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/zh-cn/support/everything/)
Not much to say about it, it's the best file search for Windows. Once you get used to the convenience of searching with a shortcut key, you can't live without it.

## [FlowLauncher](https://www.flowlauncher.com/)
I chose this mainly because I find it visually appealing, the functionality is similar to PowerToys.Run, wox, and other launcher software. There are some plugins inside that are quite useful.

## [SnipDo](https://snipdo-app.com/)
A recently discovered global copy-paste tool (text menu). Initially used for word lookup and translation linkage, I found the copy, search, and other functions quite useful. The only drawback is that the menu loading is not very seamless.
