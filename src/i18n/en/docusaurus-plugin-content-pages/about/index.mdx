Currently a junior undergraduate (ranked 3/72 with electives | 18/97 without electives), and a Pwn player of Tianxuan/Tianshu.

Currently, I am basically retired from CTF (although I don't think I was ever actively in it), and I am considering advancing into the academic field of security (system security).

Studying for a bachelor's degree in *Cybersecurity at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications*, now doing research internships in the A&D group at [vul337](https://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/chs/vul337).

My current personal goals are ~~University of Tokyo~~/~~National University of Singapore~~/~~Tsinghua University~~/Peking University/~~Top Five Universities CS/SEC related~~

My ultimate ideal is to live in Japan like [links](https://space.bilibili.com/3816626) and then travel around the world to see the scenery.

It doesn't matter if you read the air or not, I don't want to read it myself, nor do I require others to read it, of course, you can also understand it as Low EQ.

Personality test is ~~INTP-T~~ INTP-A
